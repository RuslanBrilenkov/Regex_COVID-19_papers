# Regex_COVID-19_papers

Due to a rising second wave of COVID-19 infections, I decided to do what I can to help people find more information about the novel coronavirus.

This project is dedicated to looking for useful information about the virus from medical scientific papers using regular expressions (regex) in Python.

My idea is that everyone can use programming for their needs and to make a difference in the World. I want to encourage people using Python in day-to-day life.
Besides, I want to automate the process of searching for the information with the use of technology. 

In this case particular project, I show how we can look for the "incubation period" of COVID-19 virus, which is the time elapsed between exposure to a virus, and the first symptoms to show up. 

The main idea is that the incubation period would contain information on the number/period of hours, or days (or maybe weeks). In this way, we can adjust our regex search to look for this specific information. 
I see for now two possible limitation of this method: 
1. not every scientific medical researcher would mention incubation period in this particular format (e.g., number+day(s) or number+hour(s));
2. there may be other information not related to the incubaiton period that has exact same format.

The first point would make our data incomplete as we will be missing out on some data. 
The second point would contaminate our data sample with random numbers. 

Even with these two drawbacks, which require further development, I am happy to be able to create an application which will find useful information from the medical scientific papers without actually reading them. Besides, these drawbacks are more like challenges which are great ways to improve our logical, technical, and programming skills at the same time.
