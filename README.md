Due to a rising second wave of COVID-19 infections, I decided to do what I can to help people find more information about the novel coronavirus. 

This project is dedicated to looking for useful information about the virus from medical scientific papers using regular expressions (regex) in Python. 

My idea is that everyone can use programming for their needs and to make a difference in the World. I want to encourage people using Python in day-to-day life.
